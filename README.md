### Distro-specific guide

[Guide for Pop!\_OS 22.04](docs/popos-22-04.md)

### Troubleshooting

1. The video doesn't play / The extension is enabled but nothing happens  
   The GTK4 media backend is not pre-installed on some distributions (such as PopOS).

   To install the backend:  
    `sudo apt install libgtk-4-media-gstreamer`

2. High CPU usage during video playback (proprietary NVIDIA)  
   Your hardware acceleration may not work properly, see this [issue](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/-/issues/1478).

   To delete the GStreamer cache:  
    `rm -rf ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0/`  
    After that, check if `gst-inspect-1.0 nvcodec` reports all its features.

3. The GNOME Shell keeps crashing after enabling Hanabi, help!  
   You can try to disable the extension from tty (Ctrl+Alt+F3):

   ```
   gnome-extensions disable hanabi-extension@jeffshee.github.io
   ```

4. The video covers several UI components of GNOME Shell, such as topbar, panel, DING's desktop icons, etc.  
   Affects: GNOME 44, and possibly GNOME 43.  
   The cause of the issue is still unknown. However, it consistently occurs after a shell restart (reboot or re-login). Switching the workspace (Ctrl + Alt + ‚¨Ö or ‚û°) somehow temporarily fixes the issue until the next shell restart.

### Optimization

Hanabi extension can utilize `clappersink` from [Clapper](https://github.com/Rafostar/clapper) for the best performance if installed.

For this to work, Clapper must be installed **from the package manager and not from Flatpak**.

- Without `clappersink` (Using `Gtk.MediaFile` as default fallback)
